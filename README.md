GCC BRIG frontend
=================

Note: As of 2017-01-24 the GCC BRIG frontend has been [upstreamed to
the GCC project](https://gcc.gnu.org/viewcvs/gcc/trunk/gcc/brig/ChangeLog?view=markup&pathrev=244867).
That is, its main development and maintenance will continue in GCC's subversion trunk.

This repository's trunk-updates branch will be used to track patches that
have not yet been upstreamed.
